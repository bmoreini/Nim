/* Nim Simple Kata */

/* Initialize global variables */

// declare variable games and set equal to 0

/* Main */

// while again is equal to true 
	// variable count equal to 0 
	// variable turns equal to 0
	// variable next to the remainder of games divided by 2 (modulus)

	// while count is not greater than or equal to 21, 
		// if next is equal to 0, call cpuTurn
		// else if next is not equal to 0, call userTurn
		// after a cpuTurn or userTurn, add turn int to variable count
		// add 1 to turns
	 	// call nextSwitch
	// -- loop back into next = 0 --

	// after while loop, since count is greater than or equal to 21
		// call function declare winner
